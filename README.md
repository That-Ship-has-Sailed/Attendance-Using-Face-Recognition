# Attendance Using Face Recognition in Python
This project was made to simplify the task of attendance marking. The traditional practices include attendance by roll calls and signing the attendance list. In this project, the faculty member just has to click a picture of the class and the program does the rest. The program determines which lecture it is and in which class it is, from the faculty member's time table and marks attendance in the proper excel sheet. The project also shows a graph of the attendance trends for a particular course around the semester. The project also calculates the defaulter list for students whose attendance is lesser than the given threshold.
